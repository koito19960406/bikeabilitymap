This repo is used to produce a dashboard of bikeability (bike-friendliness) in Singapore and Tokyo.

Please read [my published paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354710278_Assessing_bikeability_with_street_view_imagery_and_computer_vision) to learn more about it!

You can see the dashboard [here](https://koichi-ito.shinyapps.io/bikeabilitymap/) and download the data as well!
